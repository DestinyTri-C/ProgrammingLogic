        <h1>Destiny</h1> 
        <p>My name is Destiny, I'm 16 years old looking forward to geting a career in IT when I graduate. I want 
            to be a information security anaylst because from researching it, I think it fits me the most and I'm 
            more interested in doing what they do. Information Security Analysts protect an organization's computer network and systems 
            by devleoping strategies to prevent cyberattacks. 

            I'm currently taking an Excel Tecc program at my school that prepares high school students for their 
            future career and enhances skills. I am also taking College Credit Plus Classes which is for students
            who want to earn college credits while still in high school. I have heard that if I finish the Excel Tecc 
            Program I could get a small IT job while in college. I can't wait to learn new stuff in this course 
            and understand web programming.</p>
